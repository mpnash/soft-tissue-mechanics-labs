***************************************************
Lab 1: Analysing deformation in isotropic materials
***************************************************

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

The objective of this lab is to analyse large deformation kinematics with respect to reference coordinates in isotropic materials. The deformations you will be analysing include:

  - Model 1 (Uniaxial extension of a unit cube)
  - Model 2 (Equibiaxial extension of a unit cube)
  - Model 3 (Simple shear of a unit cube)
  - Model 4 (Shear of a unit cube)
  - Model 5 (Extension and shear of a unit cube)

Before starting this lab, please read the :ref:`Using OpenCMISS <using-opencmiss>` section to familiarise yourself with the software used in this lab.

===================================
Section 1: Solving mechanics models
===================================

1. Start OpenCMISS and load the kinematics analysis project (described in the :ref:`Starting OpenCMISS <starting-OpenCMISS>` section).

|vspace|

2. Select "Model 1 (uniaxial extension of a unit cube)" from the drop down menu and click the "run" button (screenshots of this procedure are shown in the :ref:`Running models in OpenCMISS <running-models-in-OpenCMISS>` section).

|vspace|

3. After a short time, the model should have solved and the simulation results pane will open as shown in the screenshot below.

  |vspace|

  The simulation results are shown in the 3D graphics window. In this graphical window:

      - the undeformed (reference) configuration of the unit cube is shown in red; and
      - the deformed (current) configuration is shown in green (:math:`x_{1}`, :math:`x_{2}`, :math:`x_{3}` components of the deformed coordinates are shown at the corners of the model).

  The model in the 3D graphics window can be rotated (click-drag-left-mouse button), translated (click-drag-middle-mouse button), or zoomed (click-drag-right-mouse button).

==========================
Section 2: Strain analysis
==========================

4. Write down the coordinate equations that describe this deformation in the form :math:`\boldsymbol{x}=f(\boldsymbol{X})`, i.e.:

  .. math::

    x_1 = aX_1 + bX_2 + cX_3\\
    x_2 = dX_1 + eX_2 + fX_3\\
    x_3 = gX_1 + hX_2 + iX_3

  where the constants :math:`a` to :math:`i` need to be identified from the undeformed and deformed coordinates of the model shown in the graphics window.

.. note::

   The undeformed (reference) configuration is the unit cube shown in red.

|vspace|

5. Determine the deformation gradient tensor :math:`(\boldsymbol{F}=\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{x}}{\partial\boldsymbol{X}})`.

|vspace|

6. Evaluate the determinant of :math:`\boldsymbol{F}` to see whether the material is incompressible (i.e. maintains constant volume).

|vspace|

7. Determine:

  - right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor :math:`(\boldsymbol{C})`,
  - :math:`I_1=trace(\boldsymbol{C})`,
  - :math:`I_3=det(\boldsymbol{C})`, and the
  - Green-Lagrange strain tensor :math:`(\boldsymbol{E})`.

|vspace|

8. Check your answers to 5-7 against the simulation results.

  .. _opening_simulation_pane:

  .. Note::

      Click and drag on the right hand boundary of the 3D graphics window to view the simulation results as shown in the screenshots below:

      .. image:: images/showing_simulation_results1.png

      .. image:: images/showing_simulation_results2.png

  .. Note::

      Some of the numbers are not identically=0 due to Round-off error. Assume any number less than 1E-10=0.

|vspace|

9. Select "Problem" from the menu bar and repeat steps 2-8 for the remaining models in the kinematics analysis project:

    - Model 2 (Equibiaxial extension of a unit cube)
    - Model 3 (Simple shear of a unit cube)
    - Model 4 (Shear of a unit cube)
    - Model 5 (Extension and shear of a unit cube)

=========
Questions
=========

After you have completed the above exercises, answer the following questions: 

a. What do the off-diagonal components of :math:`\boldsymbol{F}` mean?

|vspace|

b. In model 1, why are :math:`E_{22}` and :math:`E_{33}` negative?

|vspace|

c. In model 4, why are :math:`F_{11}` and :math:`F_{33}` the same (what does it represent)? Why is :math:`F_{22}` less than 1.

|vspace|

.. note::

  By the end of section 1 you should be able to:

    - analyse large deformation kinematics with respect to reference coordinates, i.e. by determining :math:`\boldsymbol{F}`, :math:`\boldsymbol{C}`, invariants of :math:`\boldsymbol{C}`, and :math:`\boldsymbol{E}`.

    - relate the components of the deformation gradient tensor to the underlying deformation.

    - determine if a material is incompressible.
